        "text": "Large language models have ushered in a new era of artificial intelligence research. However, their substantial training costs hinder further development and widespread adoption. In this paper, inspired by the redundancy in the parameters of large language models, we propose a novel training paradigm: Evolving Subnetwork Training (EST). EST samples subnetworks from the layers of the large language model and from commonly used modules within each layer, MultiHead Attention (MHA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). By gradually increasing the size of the subnetworks during the training process, EST can save the cost of training. We apply EST to train GPT2 model and TinyLlama model, resulting in $26.7\\%$ FLOPs saving for GPT2 and $25.0\\%$ for TinyLlama without an increase in loss on the pre-training dataset. Moreover, EST leads to performance improvements in downstream tasks, indicating that it benefits generalization. Additionally, we provide intuitive theoretical studies based on training dynamics and Dropout theory to ensure the feasibility of EST. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenDFM/EST .",

However, numerous studies have highlighted the redundancy in the parameters of large language models, manifested in the over-parameterization ( Li et al. ,2020 ) and conditional sparsity ( Li et al. ,2023b ) of these models.

MoE methods ( Fedus et al. ,2022 ;Du et al. ,2022 ) apply conditional computation according to different inputs in order to scale up models without significantly increasing training costs. The drawback of the MoE model is that its performance cannot match that of the dense model with an equivalent number of parameters. Another category of sparse training methods is based on the lottery ticket hypothesis ( Frankle & Carbin ,2019 ;Chen et al. ,2021 ), that certain subnetworks exhibit comparable performance to that of the original complete network. However, the sparsity generated by such methods is typically unstructured, making it challenging to translate into acceleration on general GPU devices. Monarch ( Dao et al. ,2022a ) and Pixelated Butterfly ( Dao et al. ,2021 ) lower the training overhead of models without compromising their performance by introducing structured sparsity in matrix operations, which are more low-level and can be combined with our approach for complementary benefits.

However, more importantly, we find that even in the final stage of training the complete model, the Hessian matrix still maintains a relatively small trace until the end of training. This contributes to the better generalization performance of the final model obtained through EST. ",

We propose a novel training method, Evolving Subnetwork Training (EST), which operates subnetwork training via random sampling and uses sampling scheduler to plan the process of training incrementally. Our approach enhances the efficiency of model training on GPT2 and TinyLlama models, saving $26.7\\%$ and $25.0\\%$ of training FLOPs respectively, with comparable pre-training performance. In addition, EST benefits the generalization ability of both GPT2 and TinyLlama, evaluated by several downstream tasks. We also provide intuitive theory studies, demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of EST. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the efficient training dynamics of EST comes from the flatness of parameters. This insight may inspire other efficient training methods. In future works, we aim to provide the theoretical support for the design of sampling schedulers, to apply EST for training on even larger models. Additionally, since EST essentially samples for matrix multiplication, it can be applied not only to Transformer models but also to models like Mamba ( Gu & Dao ,2023 ). We will conduct experiments on other types of models to broaden the application scope of EST. ",
