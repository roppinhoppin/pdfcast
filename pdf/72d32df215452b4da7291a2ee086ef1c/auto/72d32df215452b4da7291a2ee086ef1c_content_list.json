This is related to Bohr and Sommerfeld’s early approach to quantum physics, the ‘ old quantum theory ’, which was later subsumed by the theory of ‘ geometric quantization ’. In Bohr and Sommerfeld’s approach, when we quantize a classical system with one position and one momentum degree of freedom, there is one quantum state for each region of area $h$ in the $p q$ plane. More generally, when we quantize a classical system with $n$ position $R\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and $n$ momentum degrees of freedom, there should be one quantum state for each region with ",
